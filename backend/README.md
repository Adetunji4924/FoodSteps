# This contains backend instructions

i created a requirements.txt file. when you pull recent changes, download the requirements.txt content using :

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

When you download a new dependency or package, add it to the requirements.txt using:

`pip freeze > requirements.txt`

That way we can avoid errors, you can also pass code instructions to me using this Readme file. :hugs:
